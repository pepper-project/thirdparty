# Pepper Project #
## Third party software ##

This repository contains the releases of various third-party software
that the [Pepper system](https://github.com/pepper-project/pepper) requires.

Note that in som cases newer versions of this code is available, and for
the most part those newer versions should work. The versions we
distribute here are the ones we use in our experiments, and should be
used when replicating our published numbers.
